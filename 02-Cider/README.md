# Cider

Based on [HowToMakeHardCider.com](http://www.howtomakehardcider.com). I used a gallon of Whole Foods apple juice and white wine yeast, but that was about it.

Basically the same as [../04-Cider] but *with* secondary fermentation.

It did not turn out good.

## Recipe
* 1 gallon Whole Foods apple juice
* About 1 gram of Lalvin E-1118

## Bottling day
* Added 2 packets stevia to sweeten
* 1/2 cup water + 2 tbsp corn sugar for carbonation
* 6 bottles plus one partial for testing

## Tasting notes
Pretty gross. Came out really strong, but I don't have a hydrometer at home so I'm not sure *how* strong. All the sugar fermented out, so it was *not* very good.

## Timeline
