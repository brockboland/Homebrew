# Weizen
This recipe came from the [Zymurgy Introduction to Homebrewing issue](http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/magazine/zymurgy-introduction-homebrewing/) (which is free!)

## Recipe
* 3 kg Munton's wheat LME

The recipe in the magazine called for a one-gallon, 30-minute boil. I boiled 5.5 gallons, but stuck with the 30-minute boil.

OG: 1.044

## Bottling Day
* FG 1.014
* 3.9% ABV
* Primed with 6.2 oz corn sugar

## Tasting notes
Pretty alright. Not a great weizen, but a decent one. Kinda tangy.

* Hops: $1.79
* Yeast: $5.85
* Total: $33.54
