# Cider

Basically the same as [../02-Cider] but without secondary fermentation.

## Recipe
* 1 gallon Whole Foods apple juice
* About 1 gram of Lalvin E-1118

On bottling day:
* Added 2 packets stevia to sweeten
* 1/2 cup water + 2 tbsp corn sugar for carbonation
* 7 bottles plus one partial for testing

## Tasting notes
Pretty gross. Came out really strong, but I don't have a hydrometer at home so I'm not sure *how* strong. All the sugar fermented out, so it was *not* very good.

## Timeline
* 2014.06.15: Pitched yeast
* 2014.07.03: Bottling day (18 days in primary)
