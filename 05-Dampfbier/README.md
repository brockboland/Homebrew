# Dampfbier
This recipe was put together by Joe Falck at [CHAOS](http://www.chaosbrewclub.net/). We brewed it together for the [Brew-BQ](http://www.chaosbrewclub.net/event/chaos-summer-brew-bq-ii). It was my first all-grain brew.

## Recipe
* 7 lb pils
* 3 lb Munich
* 1/4 oz Magnum (50 min)
* 1/4 oz Magnum (10 min)
* 3 g calcium chloride (flameout)

Mash at 153 F (actually hit about 158) in 14 qts. Sparged at 168 F, with 21 qt.

90 minute boil, to clear the beer a bit, and started adding hops at 50 min.

* Pre-boil: 1.032
* OG: 1.054

## Kegging Day
* FG 1.012
