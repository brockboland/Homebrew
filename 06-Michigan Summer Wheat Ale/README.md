# Michigan Summer Wheat Ale

Recipe from [BYO magazine](https://byo.com/stories/issue/item/2103-michigan-summer-wheat-ale). This was my second all-grain brew, and the first I did on my own. I brewed this after the [Dampfbier](../05-Dampfbier), and it was a long day.

I messed up my sparge (again: my second all-grain) so the gravity came out low.

## Brewing day

## Bottling day
* FG 1.012

## Tasting notes
MEH. Alcohol is way too low. Tastes like a cheap American light lager or something.

$23.51 total for ingredients
