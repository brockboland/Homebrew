# PSaLe
Pumpkin Spice Ale, brewed for the [CHAOS Harvest Fest](http://www.chaosbrewclub.net/event/chaos-harvest-fest-iv). This was my third all-grain brew (second unsupervised), and I'm pretty happy with the results. It's a solid ale, though the pumpkin is reeeally subtle. I'd like to add more pumpkin spice next time, and maybe put the pumpkin in the boil instead of the mash.
