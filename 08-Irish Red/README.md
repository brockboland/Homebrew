# Irish Red
Norhtern Brewer had a promotion a few months ago for a brewing kit that included a few things I wanted (and several I didn't) at a really good price. It also came with two extract kits, and the Irish Red was one of them.

I did this one true homebrew style, even though [CHAOS](http://www.chaosbrewclub.net/) has an amazing brewhouse with plenty of equiment. I followed the instructions and only boiled 2.5 gallons, chilled the wort in a small pot in the fridge, and topped off the carboy with tap water. Fancy!

## Recipe
Specialty grains:
* 0.5 lbs Belgian Cara 8
* 0.25 lbs Briess Special Roast
* 0.125 lbs Belgian Biscuit
* 0.125 lbs English Chocolate Malt

Extract:
* 6 lbs Gold Malt syrup

Hops:
* 1 oz Willamette (60 min)
* 1 oz US Goldings (30 min)

What I actually did:
* Specialty grains in at 120 F, continued heating for 25 minutes
* Additions:
  * 1 oz Willamette (60 min)
  * 1 oz Willamette (30 min) - instead of US Goldings
  * 1 tsp Irish moss (10 min)
  * 1 oz US Goldings (flamout) - not in the recipe
* Added cold tap water to reach 5 gallons
* OG 1.046
