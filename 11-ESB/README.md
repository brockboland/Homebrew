# ESB
"Programmer's Elbow" from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8). I'm doing the all-grain version, and had to adjust the grain bill and hops a bit due to availability.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 12 lbs English pale
* 0.5 lb Crystal 15
* 0.25 lb Crystal 120

Mash & Boil:
* Mash at 152 F for 60 minutes
* Boil 60 minutes

Boil additions:
* 2 oz. Kent Goldings (60 min)
* 1 oz. Kent Goldings (0 min)

Fermenter additions:
* 2 packs Wyeast 1968 London ESB

## Brewing day
* Actual recipe used, due to availability:
  * Replace 0.5 lb Crystal 15 with 0.25 lb each Caramel 10 and 20
  * Replace all hops with Fuggles
* Mash with 18 qts
* Sparge was sort of batch, sort of fly (I was winging it)
* Boil volume: about 7.5 gallons
* Forgot to add Irish Moss (oh well, it'll still be beer)
* OG: 1.064
* Just over 5 gal into the fermenter

## Bottling day
* FG: 1.016
* 5.8% ABV
* 38 12-ounce bottles
* Primed with 3.3 oz corn sugar

## Tasting notes

## Timeline
* 2015.01.11: Brew day
* 2015.02.06: Bottling day
* 2015.03.06: Discovered that all bottles were infected :-( Not sure what I did wrong: I bottled the BPA the same day, and that one was fine, so it was either something in the fermenter, or I failed to properly sanitize the bottling bucket in between batches.
