# Belgian Pale Ale
"Antwerp Afternoon" from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8). I'm doing the all-grain version, and had to adjust the hops and yeast due to availability.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 11.2 lbs continental Pilsner
* 0.75 lb CaraMunich (60°L)
* 0.25 lb Biscuit (25°L)

Mash & Boil:
* Mash at 152 F for 60 minutes
* Boil 90 minutes

Boil additions:
* 1.3 oz. Kent Goldings (60 min)
* 0.3 oz. Kent Goldings (0 min)

Fermenter additions:
* 2 packs Wyeast 3655 Belgian Shelde

## Brewing day
* Actual recipe used, due to availability:
  * Replace all hops with Fuggles
  * Replace yeast with Wyeast 1214 Belgian Abbey
* Mash with 18 qts
* Boil volume: about 8.5 gallons
* 90 minute boil
* OG: 1.052
* about 6 gallons into the fermenter

## Bottling day
* FG: 1.010
* 5.5% ABV
* 45 12-ounce bottles
* Primed with 4.5 oz corn sugar

## Tasting notes
I'm really happy with it. Not spectacular, but no off-flavors and decidedly Belgian. Maybe a bit too sweet, which is surprising since it finished at 1.010.

## Timeline
* 2015.01.17: Brew day
* 2015.02.06: Bottling day
* 2015.04.07: Still really good, maybe still a bit sweet. Wishing it were carbonated more.
