# Eldorado Superly
Based on [a recipe from Bull City Homebrew](http://www.bullcityhomebrew.com/recipes.aspx?id=El%20Dorado%20Pale%20Ale%20%28All%20Grain%29.xml), and named after [a Drupal module written by a former co-worker](https://www.drupal.org/project/eldorado_superfly). The first hop addition on this one was at 20 minutes, which I've never seen before; I suppose we'll see how it turns out.

This was a dry run for the CHAOS [Cerveza de Mayo](http://www.chaosbrewclub.net/event/cerveza-de-mayo-0) in a few months. We tend to get a lot of hoppy IPAs and beers with Mexican spices and the like, so I was aiming for a mellower pale ale for those who come looking for an easy-drinker. I'm not sure how hoppy this will really turn out, though, so I thought I'd do a batch now so I can adjust the recipe in time to brew another batch for the party.
