# Scotch Ale
Scottish Export (80/-) from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8). I did the all-grain version.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 9.5 lbs English pale
* 0.5 lb Munich
* 1 lb Crystal 40
* 0.5 lb Honey malt
* 0.25 lb Crystal 120
* 3 oz Pale chocolate (200 Â°L)

Mash & Boil:
* Mash at 158 F for 60 minutes
* Boil 60 minutes

Boil additions:
* 1 oz. Kent Goldings (60 min)
* Irish moss (15 min)

Fermenter additions:
* Wyeast 1056 American Ale

## Brewing day
* Mash with 18 qts, for about 80 minutes because I forgot to heat sparge water (whoops), so it sat a little longer
* Batch sparge
* Boil volume: about 8.5 gallons
* 90 minute boil
* OG: 1.056
* About 5.5 gal into the fermenter (carboy)
* Used a 2L starter for the yeast: started on Wed, put in the fridge Fri evening to cold crash ahead of Sat brew day. The yeast didn't all stir up when I pitched, so I added some of the remaining hop slurry from the kettle (since it had been boiled) to shake it loose and pitch the remainder. Don't know how that will affect things, but there was definite activity when I checked on it two days later.

## Bottling day
* FG: 1.0xx
* x.x% ABV
* xx 12-ounce bottles
* Primed with x.x oz corn sugar
