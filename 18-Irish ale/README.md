I got kind of busy this summer, and this sat in primary for two and a half months before kegging. I'm hoping that's a good thing: I checked the gravity after 2 or 3 weeks, and though I failed to write it down, I know it was higher than I wanted it to be. It also doesn't hurt to let a malty beer like this sit for a little while, so I'm hoping it's better off for the extra time.

Update: It was actually pretty good! It wasn't tapped until two and a half months after the brew day, then half of it sat in my living room for two more months. Incredibly, five months after brewing, it's still pretty decent.
