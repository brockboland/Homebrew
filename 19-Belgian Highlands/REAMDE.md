From issue 97 of [Beer Advocate magazine](http://www.beeradvocate.com/), in an article about Belgian brewers getting inspiration from the Scottish. Sounds interesting!

## Tasting notes

## Timeline
* 2015.06.21: Brew day. It came out a lot darker than I was expecting: I had never heard of Carafa II Special before I got to the brew store the other day, so I didn't realize how much dark malt would be going into this.
