# Russian Imperial Stout
Mike Riddle's Tricentennial Stout from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8). I did the all-grain version. The recipe called for 15.7 pounds of the base malt, but recommended bumping that to 20 or 22 pounds on lower-efficiency setups. I stopped at 18.5, since that maxed out my mash tun.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 18.5 lb British pale
* 2 lb wheat malt
* 2.5 lb roasted barley
* 2.5 lb chocolate malt
* 0.85 lb Crystal 120Â°

Mash:
* Mash at 149 F for 90 minutes

Boil additions:
* 2.6 oz Northern Brewer (60 min)
* 2 oz Northern Brewer (30 min)
* 1 oz Northern Brewer (15 min)
* 2 oz Kent Goldings (15 min)
* Irish moss (15 min)
* 3 oz Kent Goldings (3 min)

Yeast:
* Wyeast 1084 Irish Ale (4 packs, no starter)

Notes:
* Target OG: 1.100
* Recipe calls for dry hopping with 2 oz Kent Goldings for 7 days. Not sure if I'll bother with this.

## Brewing day
