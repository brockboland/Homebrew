# Belgian Pale Ale
Based on "Antwerp Afternoon" from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8), with some tweaks: I had a sack of British pale malt, and the yeast specified by the recipe wasn't available. I'm using the same yeast as [the last time I brewed this recipe](../12-BPA).

I got distracted when the boil started and only tossed in the 0.3 oz of hops that I'd measured out, and not the other ounce that was supposed to go with it. I added that a bit later when I realized my mistake and extended the boil a bit, so hopefully it comes close to evening out, but I don't have high hopes for this brew.
