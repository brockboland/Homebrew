# Belgian Pale Ale
Based on "Antwerp Afternoon" from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8), with some tweaks: I had a sack of British pale malt, and the yeast specified by the recipe wasn't available. I'm using the same yeast as [the last time I brewed this recipe](../12-BPA)
