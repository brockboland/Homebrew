# ESB
"Programmer's Elbow" from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8). I'm doing the all-grain version. I [brewed this once before](../11-ESB) about a year ago. The brew shop didn't have London ESB yeast, so I went with S-04 this time around.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 12.25 lbs English pale
* 0.5 lb Crystal 15 (brew store doesn't have 15, so I used half 10 and half 20)

Mash & Boil:
* Mash at 152 F for 60 minutes
* Boil 60 minutes

Boil additions:
* 2 oz. Kent Goldings (60 min)
