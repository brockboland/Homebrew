# Irish Red
From [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8). I did the all-grain version.

Ths one sat in the fermenter way longer than usual: I messed up my back shortly after brewing it, and wasn't able to do anything with it for a while.

## Tasting notes
On bottling day, the sample I pulled tasted a bit cidery, and the final gravity was lower than I expected. I pulled a sample a couple weeks ago that tasted more like what I expected it to, and I'm worried I may have introduced unwanted bacteria in the process.
