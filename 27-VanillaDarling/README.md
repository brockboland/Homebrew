# Vanilla Darling
For a [CHAOS barrel-aging project](https://www.chaosbrewclub.net/forum/barrel-aging/vanilla-darling-high-west-barrel-2016). This was planned to go into a High West rye barrel for about a year, and wound up in a bourbon barrel instead.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 19 lbs US two-row
* 1.62 lb Munich
* 0.81 lb Belgian Debittered
* 2.16 lb Roasted barley
* 1.35 lb chocolate malt
* 2.16 lb crystal 60

Mash & Boil:
* Mash at 155 F for 90 minutes
* Boil 120 minutes

Boil additions:
* 2 oz. Willamette (75 min)
* 1 oz. Willamette (30 min)
* 1 oz. Willamette (0 min)

Fermenter additions:

## Brewing day
* Brewed on the Tower of Power, doing a 10-gallon batch with Josh S
* Boil volume: 15.5 gallons
* Target gravity: 1.129
* OG: 1.112

## Bottling day
My buddy John bottled up some bombers to send me, since I had moved out of town by the time the barrel was emptied. I don't know what the final gravity or ABV was.

## Flavoring
3 Madagascar vanilla beans were soaked in the 5 gallons for five days.
