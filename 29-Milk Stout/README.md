# Milk Stout
The sweet stout from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8). I did the all-grain version.

I'm hoping this one turns out OK. The shop was out of Kent Goldings, so I got US Goldings instead. I didn't notice until the boil had started that [they were labeled as 15.6% alpha acid](HopsUsed.JPG)—which seems absurd, since everything I can find online says they should be in the 4–6 range. I'm guessing it was just a typo, because I checked [the rest of the hops I bought at the same time](HopsCompared.JPG), and some are labeled at 5.6%.

I also bumped the grain up from 10 to 10.5 pounds to account for the fact that I had a bit less than a pound of lactose (I'd used a bit for another project). That wasn't measured, really—I just kind of ballparked it.
