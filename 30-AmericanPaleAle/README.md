# American Pale Ale
My first brew in over a year. I moved from Chicago to Seattle, and in so doing, left behind the shared brewing space at CHAOS. This is the first time I've actually *home*brewed, and it went smoother than I epxected! This is the basic American pale ale recipe that came with the MoreBeer.com starter kit. I ball-parked things more than usual, since I'm just getting my legs back under me.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 1 lb Crystal 15 L
* 7 lbs ultralight LME

Mash & Boil:
* Mash the Crystal 15 for 30 minutes, around 150-170 F
* Boil 60 minutes

Boil additions:
* 1 oz. Magnum (60 min)
* 1 oz. Cascade (5 min)
* 1 oz. Cascade (1 min)

Fermenter additions:
* 1 Safale S-04

## Brewing day
* Boil volume: about 3 gallons
* Added bottled spring water to bring fermenter up to 5 gallons
* OG: 1.044
* About 5 gallons into the fermenter
* Fermented in wide-mouthed plastic carboy

## Bottling day
About 4.5 gallons went into the bottling bucket, but not all of that made it into bottles. I ran out of bottles, for one, but the sample I pulled for a gravity reading seemed to have a lot floating around in it, so I was happy to leave the dregs behind in both the fermenter and the bottling bucket, to cut down on the amount that went into the bottles.

* FG: 1.011
* 4.3% ABV
* 11 bombers and 16 12-ounce bottles
* Primed with 4 oz corn sugar

## Tasting notes
Mixed bag. Some bottles were raelly oxygenated, like they were pulled from soggy cardboard boxes that had been sitting in an earthern basement since the 70s. Some were just fineâ€”not great, but fine, and very drinkable. Not a bad start for homebrewing in Seattle.
