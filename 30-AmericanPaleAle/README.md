# American Pale Ale
My first brew in over a year. I moved from Chicago to Seattle, and in so doing, left behind the shared brewing space at CHAOS. This is the first time I've actually *home*brewed, and it went smoother than I epxected! This is the basic American pale ale recipe that came with the MoreBeer.com starter kit. I ball-parked things more than usual, since I'm just getting my legs back under me.
