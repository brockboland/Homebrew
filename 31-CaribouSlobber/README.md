# Caribou Slobber
Only my second brew since moving to Seattle. My friend Matt joined me for his first-ever brew day, so maybe I'll have a brew buddy for some future recipes. 

I totally spaced when I got the [ingredient kit from Northern Brewer](https://www.northernbrewer.com/caribou-slobber-extract-kit) and forgot to freeze the hops. They sat in my garage for a couple months, so I'm not sure how the flavor is going to turn out after such temperature changes. Plus, our final volume came in a bit low, but whatever: RDWHAHB.
