# Dead Ringer IPA
This was my first attempt at brew in a bag, and I'm not sure how it went.

I started with 4 gallons in the kettle, and mashed in with the [Brew Bag](https://www.brewinabag.com/). My mash temp was on the high side, because I didn't expect the kettle to maintain temperature very well. I started it around 162 F and expected that it would fall pretty quickly, but toward the end of the hour, it was only at 156 F. I lifted out the bag and squeezed it as well as I could with only one handâ€”for next time, I need to find a way to hang the bag over the kettle. I added some water to top the boil up to around 4 gallons, but I should have added more, because I only put about 2.5 gallons into the fermenter. My gravity was low, too, and I'm not sure the high mash temp might have hurt me there.

On the bright side, this is the first time I'll have real temperature control. I've had an old mini fridge for a while now, but it's just been the beer fridge in the garage. I finally picked up an [Inkbird ITC-308 temperature controller](https://amzn.to/2Llxwxc) so I can use it as a fermentation chamber.
