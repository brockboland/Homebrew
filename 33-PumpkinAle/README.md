# Pumpkin Ale
Second brew in a bag attempt. I scaled down the AHA recipe [Julie: A Pumpkin Belgian Strong Ale](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/julie-pumpkin-belgian-strong-ale/) for a three-gallon batch.

This brew did not go well. I had a hard time with mash temp: I got the strike water up to about 162 before adding the grain, pumpkin, and Nugget, and my temp was around 146 after wards. I used the burner on low to bring up the temp while stirring, and hope I didn't do too much damage to my [Brew Bag](https://www.brewinabag.com/) in the process.

Then, the pumpkin gummed up the whole works, so I had trouble squeezing as much wort out of the bag as I would have liked. I added a half-pound of sugar to the kettle in an attempt to compensate for the missing starches, but my gravity was still way lower than I was aiming for. Another half-can of pumpkin in the boil meant there was a ton of trub, so I only got about 2 gallons into the fermenter.

I don't have high hopes for this one, but I hope the Belgian yeast makes it interesting.
