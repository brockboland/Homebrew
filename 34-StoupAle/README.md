# Stoup Zoiglbier
This one's a bit of a mystery! [Stoup Brewing](http://www.stoupbrewing.com/) offered to do a wort share with my club, North Seattle Homebrewers. I'm told it's a Zoiglbier and the grain bill used Vienna, pils, and maybe Munich? And I think they said they hopped with Hallertau. I'm not one to look a gift wort in the mouth, so I didn't ask too many questions. I used some yeast that I got at [Homebrewcon](https://www.homebrewcon.org/), and we'll see what we get! We're going to get together at some point for a bottle share, to sample what everyone did with it.

## Timeline
* 2018.10.24 Brew day
* 2018.10.25: Pitched yeast
* 2018.11.07: Bottling day
* 2018.04.11: Still tasting pretty good! It's smoother out a bit, if anything. Usually, my bottles are way oxygenated by now.
