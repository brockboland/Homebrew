# Chocolate Milk Stout
This was a partial mash kit from [Northern Brewer](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/chocolate-milk-stout-extract-kit). It fermented on the cool side, because I don't have a heater for my ferm chamber and it's getting chilly out.

This was the first time I did a closed transfer to a keg, so I'm hoping to avoid oxygenation issues I've had with bottling before (though it would probably fly under the radar in this stout).
