# Belgian Pale Ale
A bit of a departure from previous Belgian pales I've done, because I'm using hops I had handy. I don't really use BeerSmith, but tried tweaking my recipe in there and following the recommendations for strike water volume/temperature and so forth.

Efficiency on this was way low: 56%. I came in low on gravity in my last brew too, so I need to figure out what I'm doing wrong hereâ€”or start rounding up more on my grain bills.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 7.2 lb pilsner
* 0.5 lb Caramunich 60
* 0.19 lb Biscuit

Mash & Boil:
* Mash at 152 F
* Mashout at 168 F for 10 minutes
* Boil 60 minutes
* 0.75 oz Cluster (7.8%) 60 min
* 0.50 oz Fuggle (3.2%) 0 min
* Irish moss: 15 min
* Yeast nutrient: 10 min

Fermenter additions:
* 1 Belgian Abbey Ale (Wyeast Labs #1214, mfg 11/18/2018)

## Brewing day
* Mash volume: 11.6 qt
* Boiled down for about 30 minutes to reduce volume (after sparging with too much)
* Pre-boil volume: 4.5 gal
* Pre-boil gravity: 1.049
* OG: 1.058 (target 1.070)
* 2.75 gallons into the fermenter
* Fermented in wide-mouthed plastic carboy

## Tasting notes
My initial impression was not very positive. Carbonation is low, but more importantly, it's way sweeter than I expected. My 1.004 reading had to be wrong. Lots of esters. 

I took this to my homebrew club on 2019.02.06, about two weeks after kegging, to ask what I might have done wrong. The general consensus, though, was that I didn't have any real off-flavors, just a yeast character that I don't much care for. I tossed the fermenter, just to be on the safe side. It had served me well for about a year as it was.

Ultimately, I think I'll avoid this yeast in the future, since the beer didn't have the character I wanted. 

## Timeline
* 2019.01.01: Brew day. Set fermentation fridge to 68 F.
* 2019.01.09: Bumped up to 72 F
* 2019.01.10: Removed from fermentation fridge. Left in the garage in the 60s.
* 2019.01.13: Gravity at 1.004 (seems low?). Cold-crashing to 40 F.
* 2019.01.23: Kegged in 3 gal corny. Put on CO2 around 8 psi. 
* 2019.01.31: First taste
