# Belgian Pale Ale
A bit of a departure from previous Belgian pales I've done, because I'm using hops I had handy. I don't really use BeerSmith, but tried tweaking my recipe in there and following the recommendations for strike water volume/temperature and so forth.

Efficiency on this was way low: 56%. I came in low on gravity in my last brew too, so I need to figure out what I'm doing wrong hereâ€”or start rounding up more on my grain bills.

## Recipe
Grain bill:
* 7.2 lb pilsner
* 0.5 lb Caramunich 60
* 0.19 lb Biscuit

Mash & Boil:

* Mashout at 168 F for 10 minutes

## Brewing day
* Mash volume: 11.6 qt
* Boiled down for about 30 minutes to reduce volume (after sparging with too much)
* Pre-boil volume: 4.5 gal

* OG: 1.058 (target 1.070)
