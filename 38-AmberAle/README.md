# Amber Ale
Amber ale recipe from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8), scaled down to 2.75 gallons. I don't remember what hops that recipe called for, but I've got Centennial on hand, so that's what we're doing!

## Recipe & Brew Day Notes
Grain bill:
- 5 lbs 8 oz 2 Row
- 10.4 oz Munich
- 7 oz Crystal 40L
- 4.2 oz Crystal 120L
- 4.2 oz Victory

Mash & Boil:
- Mash at 154 F with 9.2 qt for about 65 minutes
- Mashout at 173 F for 10 minutes
- Batch-ish sparge with about 3.25 gal
- Pre-boil:
	- 4.75 gallons
	- 1.039 pre-boil gravity
- 9 drops of Fermcap as coming to a boil
- Boil 75 minutes
- 0.4 oz Centennial (10.6%) 30 min
- Irish moss: 15 min
- 0.5 oz Centennial (10.6%) 10 min
- Yeast nutrient: 10 min
- 0.4 oz Centennial (10.6%) 0 min

Chill:
- OG: 1.050 (target 1.055)
- Chilled to 80 F in an ice bath, then dumped into the corny

Fermenter:
- US-05 exp 2/2021 rehydrated in about a cup of water for about 30 minutes
- Fermented in 5 gal corny keg, with blowoff hose, at 68 F

## Transfer Day
- Gravity: 1.014, 4.8% ABV
- Transferred from the fermenter into a 3 gallon corny
- Added a half teaspoon of gelatin dissolved in a half cup of water at 159 F
- Chilled to 36 F in the kegerator, with about 10 psi in the headspace but not connected to CO2

## Tasting notes
My first impression was not positive. I thought the gelatin fining didn't do the trick, but I think I just didn't get all of the sediment out, because the second pint I pulled (the next day) was pretty clear.

Outside of appearance, I think it's pretty crisp, and has pretty good aroma. Needs more body though, I think.
