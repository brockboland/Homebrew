# Double Vision IPA: Split Batch
Last year, when I was starting to brew again but still had only basic equipment, I ordered some recipe kits when Northern Brewer had them on sale. The [Dead Ringer IPA](https://www.northernbrewer.com/products/dead-ringer-ipa-extract-kit) kit has been sitting around since then, because I got a mash tun and some smaller kegs, and have been doing 3 gallon batches lately. I also forgot that I had this kit, and [brewed the all-grain BIAB version](32-DeadRingerIPA) in the meantime. I'm not really interested in brewing the same beer again, but there's no reason to let all this extract go to waste, so I decided to do a split batch with different hops and see how they turn out.

My plan:
- Mash the specialty grains in a bag for about a half hour around 155 F. I'm playing fast and loose with this part.
- Bring ~6 gallons of water to boil temp, split across two kettles so it goes faster (since I'm doing this on regular stovetop burners). One will just be water, the other will be the sorta-wort from the specialty grain.
- Combine the heated water and stir in the extract
- Divide the wort between the two kettles and start the boil

I've got an ounce of cryo Citra from Homebrewcon last year, so I'm going to use that for bittering. I'd like to try using the same hop additions for the Mosaic and Simcoe, so I'm scaling back the bittering addition on the Mosaic to hit approximately 54 IBU (per Beersmith) on both.
