# Springtime In Amarillo Saison
This [saison recipe](Recipe.png) comes from my local homebrew shop, [MicroHomebrew](https://www.microhomebrew.com/). I scaled it back to 3 gallons.

## Recipe & Brew Day Notes
### Grain bill
- 4.8 lb Belgian pilsner
- 2.4 lb white wheat
- 0.3 lb aromatic

### Mash
- Mash at 151 F for 60 min, in the brew bag in the cooler mash tun
- Mash water: 11.5 qt (pretty thin. I was aiming for 9.5, but didn't hit temp)
- Stirred at 30 min
- Sparge with 10.5 qt
- Target pre-boil volume: 4.75 gal
- Actual pre-boil volume: slightly over 4 gal
- Pre-boil gravity: about 1.042 (based on refractometer reading, but see note below)

### Boil
- 4 drops of Fermcap
- 0.5 oz Amarillo (8.5%): 60 min
- 0.5 oz Amarillo (8.5%): 15 min
- Irish moss: 15 min
- Yeast nutrient: 10 min
- 0.6 lb Cascade clear candi syrup: 5 min
- 0.5 oz Amarillo (8.5%): 0 min

After stirring in the candi syrup, I took another refractometer reading, and read 1.060, which sounded about right. But, at flameout, I got a lower readingâ€”around 1.047. I grabbed my hydrometer to check the actual OG after filling the fermenter.

### Chill
I only used the immersion chiller for a few minutes, to get it down to about 150 F, then stirred up a whirlpool to collect hop matter in the middle.

### Fermenter
- Filled the fermenter pretty hot (see chilling notes) with plans to pitch yeast tomorrow
- OG: 1.060 (target 1.066 - 1.074). I would have tossed in the rest of that pound of candi syrup if I'd realized how low I was.
- Wyeast 3711 French Saison, mfg 3/26/19
- Fermented in 5 gal corny (XXXXX)
- Set the fermentation fridge to 71F to cool it down the rest of the way overnight, to pitch yeast tomorrow

## Transfer Day
- Gravity: 1.0xx, x.x% ABV

## Final stats
- OG: 1.060
- Est. IBU: 32
- FG:
- ABV:
