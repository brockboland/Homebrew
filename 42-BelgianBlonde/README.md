# Belgian Blonde
This [recipe](Recipe.jpeg) comes from my local homebrew shop, [MicroHomebrew](https://www.microhomebrew.com/). I scaled it back to 4/5 the regular recipe this time, in hopes that I'd a: hit gravity, and b: have plenty of beer to fill the keg.

## Recipe & Brew Day Notes
### Grain bill
- 9.6 lb Belgian pilsner
- 0.6 lb aromatic
- 0.2 lb acidulated
- 0.7 lb flaked corn
- 0.8 lb Caravienne: added to last 20 minutes of mash in a mesh bag

### Mash
- Mash in the brew bag in the cooler mash tun at:
	- 138 F for 15 min: targeting 131
	- 147 F for 40 min: targeting 146
	- 150 F for 15 min: targeting 158, but I didn't have room in the tun to add enough water to bring it up that high
- Strike water: 14.5 qt, with 1 tsp gypsum and 1 tsp calcium chloride
- Sparge with 7-8 qt
- Pre-boil volume: about 5 gal

### Boil
- 5 drops of Fermcap
- 1.6 oz Czech Saaz (2.8%): 60 min
- 0.8 oz Hallertau Mittelfruh (3.1%): 10 min
- Irish moss: 10 min
- Yeast nutrient: 10 min
- 0.8 oz Styrian Goldings (3.0%): 5 min

### Chill
I only used the immersion chiller for a few minutes, then stirred up a whirlpool to collect hop matter in the middle.

### Fermenter
- Filled the fermenter pretty hot (see chilling notes) with plans to pitch yeast tomorrow. Put it in the fermentation fridge at 66 F.
- OG: 1.062 (recipe target 1.070)
- Imperial Triple Double, mfg 4/11/2019
- Fermented in 5 gal corny (66041252)

## Final stats
- OG: 1.062
- Est. IBU: 24
- FG:
- ABV:

## Tasting notes

## Timeline
- 2019.05.10: Brew day
- 2019.05.11: Pitched yeast. Going strong after 24 hours. Realized two days later that I forgot to aerate the wort, but the yeast seemed to be doing just fine.
- 2019.05.29: Dropped fermentation fridge to 37 F to cold crash
