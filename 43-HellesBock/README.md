# Helles Bock
Don't tell anybody but this is basically the [Maibock](../39-Maibock/README.md) I made a couple months ago. It's just not going to be in May, so I'm calling it a helles bock.

I only used the immersion chiller for a few minutes, bringing the wort dwon to around 130 F, then stirred up a whirlpool to collect hop matter in the middle.
