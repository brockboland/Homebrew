# Old Ale
My buddy Matt and I brewed this with plans for something of a winter warmer. I figured we'll open a few bottles later this winter, and hold the rest for next year.

The recipe is based on Old Treacle Mine from [Brewing Classic Styles](http://www.amazon.com/Brewing-Classic-Styles-Winning-Recipes-ebook/dp/B002C1AJX8). I made some substitutions, skipped the treacle, and we had to add some DME to hit the gravity we were aiming for, after maxing out the mash tun.

## Recipe & Brew Day Notes
### Grain bill
- 12.7 lb Marris Otter
- 0.6 lb Crystal 80
- 0.1 lb black patent
- 3 lb golden light DME (last 10 minutes of the boil)

### Mash
- Mash in the brew bag in the cooler mash tun
- Didn't track strike water volume or temperature. I knew we would fill the mashtun, so we kind of eyeballed the thickness and just made sure to hit the temperature.
- 153 F for 1 hour
- Fly sparge
- Pre-boil volume: about 5.75 gal
- Pre-boil gravity: about 1.050

### Boil
- Boiled for 30 minutes before any additions, to reduce volume
- Added about half a packet of Burton Water Salts from LD Carlson
- 1.4 oz Magnum (12.8%): 60 min
- Irish moss: 10 min
- Yeast nutrient: 10 min

### Chill
I put the immersion chiller into the boil for the last 5 minutes to sanitize it. I only used the chiller for a few minutes, to get it down to around 120 F, then stirred up a whirlpool to collect hop matter in the middle.

### Fermenter
- Filled the fermenter on the warm side (see chilling notes) with plans to pitch yeast later. Put it in the fermentation fridge (set at 65 F). Pitched yeast later in the evening.
- About 4.5 gallons into the fermenter
- OG: 1.090
- 2 packs of Imperial A09 Pub, mfg 24 Sept 2019
- Fermented in 5 gal corny (66041252)

## Final stats
- OG: 1.090
- FG: 1.020
- ABV: 9.4%

## Tasting notes
It's alright. Hoppier than I expected. I'm going to forget about some of these bottles and see how they mellow over time.

## Timeline
- 2019.10.06: Brew day
- 2019.11.13: Transferred to a serving keg for some aging. Outside of the fermenter was iffy, hoping the beer is ok. 
- 2019.12.21: Looking pretty clear, golden-amber, with decent head.
- 2020.03.03: Bottled the remainder, using my new Beer Gun. Filled 5 flip top bottles (500ml, I think), 10 regular 12oz bottles, and half a growlerâ€”which was a lot more than I expecetd to get out of there.
